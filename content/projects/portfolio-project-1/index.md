This project was a personal, profressional portfolio that I created as part of Northwestern's MSDS program.  Specifically, MSDS 431 Data Engineering with Go.  The website was created using Hugo, GitHub, and Netlify.  For details on the code please click on the "Source" button above which contains a link to the GitHub repo.
